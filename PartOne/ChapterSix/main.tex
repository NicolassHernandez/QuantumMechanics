%% introduction talk
In real problems, the Hamiltonian are not that easy to solve analytically. In general, the equation is too 
complicated for us to be able to find its solutions in an analytic form.

There exists, however, \bfemph{approximation methods} that enable us to obtain analytically approximate solutions 
of the basic eigenequation in certain cases. This technique is known as \bfemph{stationary perturbation theory}\index{Stationary perturbation theory}.

In studying a phenomenon or a physical system, one begins by isolating the principal effects that are responsible for the main 
features of this phenomenon or this system. Once understood, one tries to explain the finer details by taking into account less 
important effects that were neglected in the first approximation. It is in treating these secondary effects that one 
commonly uses perturbation theory.

There is also another approximation method called the \bfemph{variational method}.
